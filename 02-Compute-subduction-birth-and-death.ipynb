    "### Detect Subduction Initiation/Death\n",
    "\n",
    "- The purpose of this notebook is to automatically detect the appearance of new subduction zones, and disappearance of existing ones, within a topological plate model\n",
    "- The method compares subduction configurations against the configuration at the previous or next time snapshot, then examines the distance between each vertex along the subduction boundary at time t with the configuration at time t=t+dt or t=t-dt.\n",
    "- The distance is unlikely to be zero between timesteps, even where subduction persists, due to trench migration. So we must set a distance threshold to distinguish between changes in the configuration that reflect trench migration (small distance) and changes that reflect addition or removal of an entire segment.\n",
    "- This does not work perfectly. In many cases, the subduction line geometries change between time steps for reasons that are ambiguous (but in many cases probably not becuase the model is intended to imply actual wholesale changes in the plate boundary??). The code distinguishes between place where the subduction zone moves a lot but the plate pair across the boundary remains the same, as opposed to places where the plate pair changes (hence more likely to be a genuine change in plate boundary configuration?)\n",
    "- Various lines also included for handling of bad topological segments (for these segements, plate pair cannot be determined but still used for distance check).\n",
    "- Also added code to detect distance to nearest continental polygon at time of initiation/death"

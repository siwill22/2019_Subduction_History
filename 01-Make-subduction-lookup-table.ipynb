    "\n",
    "This notebook illustrates usage of the updated subduction zone kinematics pygplates method, using the MÃ¼ller et al AREPS model:\n",
    "\n",
    "- implemented to work directly on the plate model gpml files (whereas before, you had to export the resolved topologies at 1Myr increments first)\n",
    "- this notebook also interpolates the age of the subducting plate age from age grids if provided\n",
    "- within the notebook data are stored in pandas dataframes, and there is an illustration of how to export them to both csv or hdf5 files\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "- update 2016/07/25 to determine subduction type (intra-oceanic versus ocean-continent) by looking at nearest static polygon to each point"

## Contents

### Notebooks

The repository contains 5 notebooks.

- *00-Reconstruction-GMT-plots.ipynb* plots the reconstructed subdiction histories as shown in figure 8.

- *01-Make-subduction-lookup-table.ipynb* and *02-Compute-subduction-birth-and-death.ipynb* carry out analysis on the sites of subduction initiation and cessation with respect to continents using the reconstruction model of MÃ¼ller et al (2016) [note: must be run in order].

- *03-VDM_distances.ipynb* carries out analysis on the sites of subduction initiation and cessation with respect to continents using the interpretation of van der Meer et al (2010, 2012).

- *04-Subduction-birth-and-death-plotting.ipynb* brings together the results of notebooks 01, 02 and 03 to create the histograms as shown in figure 9 of the study.
